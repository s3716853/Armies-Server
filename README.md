## Git Branch Strategy
<!-- Maybe add a little diagram -->
main - releases when merged into and tagged 
    development - Development baseline
        f/{feature-name} - features
        b/{bug-name} - bug fixes 
        d/(documentation-desc) - changes that are exclusivly documentation based - could make a rule that d/ tickets don't require review 

## Database info
Currently the database will use MySQL which will make a little db.sqlite3 file in your code directory.

In the future postgres will probably get used since I'm used to it.
